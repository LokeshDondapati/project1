    "In this project, we will explore a dataset that is related to and focuses on \"HIV/AIDS Diagnoses by Neighborhood, Age Group, and Race/Ethnicity.\" Dataset comprises data related to HIV/AIDS daignoses per population, age, neighborhood. These race/ethnicity attribute includes Black, Asian/pacific islander, white etc. The dataset contains information on demographics, such as age, and location, as well as variables indicating per popluation, daignoses. The dataset's temporal aspect allows tracking engagement trends over time, making it an ideal subject for analysis.\n",

    "This Python code utilizes the pandas library to perform a series of operations on a dataset stored in a CSV file. First, it loads the dataset from a specific URL and stores it as a pandas DataFrame named \"data.\" It then calculates and displays two key statistics: the number of use cases, which corresponds to the rows in the dataset, and the number of attributes, equivalent to the dataset's columns. Furthermore, it extracts and lists the data types for each attribute (column) in the dataset. This code is a helpful starting point for understanding the dataset's size, structure, and the data types used in each column, all of which are fundamental aspects when working with data analysis and manipulation in Python."

The same applies to Seaborn, It specifies the 'AGE_GROUP' column from the dataset as the data source for the histogram. we specify that there should be 20 bins (bars) in the histogram, set the bars' color to blue, and add a KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) curve to the plot. The KDE curve is an estimation of the underlying probability density function of the data.\n",
